Title: How Async Network I/O Works in Python

---

# 1. Network I/O is managed by the OS

When your program requests data from a network socket (e.g., `await websocket.recv()` or `await aiohttp.get()`):

1. Python calls the OS network API (e.g., `recv` or `read` on a socket).
2. The OS doesn’t block your Python process; it registers the socket with the network stack.
3. The OS keeps track of incoming packets from the network.

# 2. How the OS knows the data is “ready”

* **TCP** ensures data arrives in order and complete.

* The OS maintains a **receive buffer** for each socket.

  * When packets arrive, the OS assembles them in the buffer.
  * When enough data is available (or connection closes), the OS marks the socket as “readable.”

* Linux/Unix uses `epoll`, `select`, or `poll`.

* Windows uses IOCP (I/O Completion Ports).

* These let Python know when the socket has data ready to read.

# 3. Event Loop’s Role

1. Python registers the socket with the event loop.
2. Event loop asks the OS: “Notify me when this socket is readable.”
3. Coroutine does `await` → suspended.
4. When OS receives enough network packets:

   * Socket marked readable.
   * Event loop wakes coroutine.
5. Coroutine resumes and reads data from the socket buffer.

No busy waiting is needed; the OS signals completion efficiently.

# 4. Analogy (Mailbox + Letter)

* Socket = mailbox
* OS = post office
* Event loop = secretary checking your mail

Steps:

1. You await a letter.
2. Secretary tells post office: "Notify me when mail arrives."
3. You go do other things.
4. Post office delivers letter into mailbox.
5. Secretary sees it → wakes you → you read it.

# 5. Key Details

* **Network packet fragmentation:** TCP splits large messages into smaller packets; OS buffers until complete.
* **Non-blocking sockets:** Python avoids blocking `recv()`, relies on OS notifications.
* **Async frameworks** (asyncio, websockets, aiohttp) wrap this logic into coroutines.
