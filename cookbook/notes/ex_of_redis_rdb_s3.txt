Perfect! Let’s visualize a simple architecture for an audio app using **S3, a relational database, and Redis**:

### **Audio App Architecture Diagram**

```
           ┌─────────────┐
           │   Client    │
           │(Web/Mobile) │
           └─────┬───────┘
                 │
                 ▼
           ┌─────────────┐
           │    Redis    │
           │  (Cache)    │
           └─────┬───────┘
      Cache hit │  Cache miss
                 ▼
           ┌─────────────┐
           │  Database   │
           │ (Postgres/  │
           │   MySQL)    │
           └─────┬───────┘
                 │
                 ▼
           ┌─────────────┐
           │     S3      │
           │ (MP3 Files) │
           └─────────────┘
```

### **How it works step by step**

1. **Client requests a song** → Check **Redis**.

   * If song is cached, serve directly (fast).
   * If not cached → go to **Database**.

2. **Database** returns metadata including **S3 URL** of the song.

3. **Client fetches the MP3 from S3** → can be streamed directly.

4. Optionally, store the song in **Redis** cache if it’s popular.

### **Why this setup?**

* **Redis:** Fast access to hot songs or playlists.
* **Relational DB:** Stores structured metadata for queries (artist, album, popularity).
* **S3:** Cheap, scalable storage for actual audio files.

This pattern is **very similar to how Spotify, YouTube, or Netflix handle media**.

You can also create a Python demo showing Redis caching + DB metadata + S3 download for a few songs as a working prototype.


----------
IP (Network layer)
    Routes packets from one device to another over the Internet.
TCP (Transport layer)
    Ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data packets.
HTTP / HTTPS (Application layer)
    HTTP: request/response communication.
    HTTPS: same as HTTP but encrypted with TLS/SSL.
    WebSocket (Application layer)
        Starts with an HTTP/HTTPS handshake, then upgrades to a persistent
        full-duplex connection for real-time communication.
