Let the circumcircle of △ ABC
is a circle that passes from each vertex of 
△ ABC.

Let the center of this circumcircle be O,
and the radius be R.

In order to calculate R, we draw a prependicular
line from the center O on the side BC, and name
the intercepted point on BC as N. 

Since BOC is an isosceles triangle, 
as two of its sides are R.
the line ON bisects the base BC. 

∠BOC is an angle at the center of the circle,
and make the same arc BC as ∠BAC. 
Therefore ∠BOC =  ∠2A and ∠BON = ∠A

-> In triangle BON, sin A =  (1/2 a) / R
   2R = a / sin A

The right hand side of this equation also 
occurs  in the sine formula.

-> 2R = (a / sin A) = (b / sin B) = (c / sin C)
   
In fact the sine formula itself can be derived
by exxtending the proof for side a (2R = a / sin A)
for the other two sides of the triangle (b and c)

2R = (b /sin b) and 2R = (c / sin C)
