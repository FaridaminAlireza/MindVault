The incricle of △ ABC
is a circle that lies inside the triangle ABC
and touches each side of triangle.
Let denote the center as O
and radius this traingle as r

Let draw prependiculars from O 
to the sides of the tirangle
and call the intercepted points 
of the circle wih sides a,b,c as
L,M,N accordingly.

Based on the formula 
for area of traingle 

area of △ BOC = 1/2 ar

Similarly the area of △ AOB and △ AOC
can be calculated as 

area of △ AOB = 1/2 br
area of △ AOC = 1/2 cr

Summing the areas get us the area of △ ABC:

 △ ABC = 1/2 ar + 1/2 br + 1/2 cr 
 = r (a+b+c)/2 

if we call a+b+c/2 as s

then  rs =  △ ABC
