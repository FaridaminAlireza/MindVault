What is an Identity in Trigonometry?

In trigonometry, an *identity* 
is an equation that is **true 
for all values** of the variable 
for which the expressions are defined.
Identities do not depend on a 
particular angle; they work universally.

Examples:
sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
tanθ = sinθ / cosθ
1 + tan²θ = sec²θ

These are always true for every θ 
where the expressions make sense.

How to Prove an Identity

There are two main methods used to
prove trigonometric identities:

---
Method 1: Manipulate One Side 
(usually the more complicated side)

• Start with the **left-hand side (LHS)** or
 **right-hand side (RHS)**
• Use known identities to simplify or transform it
• Make it match the other side

You must **not** manipulate both sides
at the same time — only transform one side
until it becomes identical to the other.

Example (Method 1):
Prove: 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ

Start with LHS:
1 + tan²θ
= 1 + (sin²θ / cos²θ)
= (cos²θ / cos²θ) + (sin²θ / cos²θ)
= (cos²θ + sin²θ) / cos²θ
= 1 / cos²θ        (since sin²θ + cos²θ = 1)
= sec²θ

Thus LHS = RHS → Identity proven.

---
Method 2: Bring All Terms to One Side 
and Show the Result is Zero

• Rewrite: (LHS − RHS) or 
(LHS + negative RHS)
• Simplify using known identities
• If the result becomes 0, 
then the identity is proven

Example (Method 2):

Prove: 1 + cot²θ = cosec²θ

Rewrite:
1 + cot²θ − cosec²θ = 0

Convert to sine and cosine:
1 + (cos²θ / sin²θ) − (1 / sin²θ)
= (sin²θ / sin²θ) +
  (cos²θ / sin²θ) − 
  (1 / sin²θ)
= (sin²θ + cos²θ − 1) / sin²θ
= (1 − 1) / sin²θ
= 0 / sin²θ
= 0

Therefore, identity proven.

Helpful Tips for Proving Identities

1. Convert everything to 
sine and cosine if unsure

2. Use algebra: 
factor, 
combine fractions,
common denominators

3. Apply famous identities:
• Pythagorean identities
• Reciprocal identities
• Quotient identities
• Compound angle identities
(if needed)

4. Don’t cross-multiply or
manipulate both sides 
(unless justified logically)

5. Work neatly — every step 
must be mathematically correct

Summary

What is an identity?
• A trigonometric equation that is true for all acceptable angle values

Two methods to prove identities:

1. Start from one side only and simplify → make it match the other side
2. Move everything to one side → simplify to show the result equals zero

These skills are important for:
• Solving trigonometric equations
• Simplifying expressions
• Advanced mathematics and physics applications
