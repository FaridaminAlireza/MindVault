"""
From the Law of Cosines, in any triangle 
with sides of lengths a, b, and c, and 
with angle θ between sides a and b, 
the relationship is:

c² = a² + b² − 2ab cos(θ)

Now consider two vectors A and B drawn from the same origin.
The angle between them is θ, and the third side of the triangle
formed by their tips is A − B.

The sides of the triangle have lengths:

|A| (length of vector A)

|B| (length of vector B)

|A − B| (distance between the tips of A and B (from B to A))

Applying the Law of Cosines to this triangle gives:

|A − B|² = |A|² + |B|² − 2|A||B| cos(θ)
