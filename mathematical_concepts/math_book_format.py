"""
University-level math books tend to follow 
a very standardized “logical” structure. 
The goal is to present ideas in a precise,
rigorous, and cumulative way, where each 
statement builds on previous ones. Below 
is a clear explanation of the common headings
you will encounter, what they mean, and 
why they are used.

## **Typical Format / Structure in University Math Books**

### **1. Definition**

**What it is:**
A *definition* introduces a new concept,
object, or notation.
**Purpose:**
To make sure everyone knows exactly what
a term means before using it rigorously.
**Example:**
> **Definition.** A *group* is a set ( G ) with an operation ( \cdot ) satisfying …

---
### **2. Remark**

**What it is:**
A *remark* is an explanatory note—something that
helps you understand a definition or theorem 
but is not logically necessary.
**Purpose:**
To give intuition, examples, warnings,
or alternative viewpoints.
**Example:**
> **Remark.** Not every binary operation
makes a group; associativity is essential.

---
### **3. Example**

**What it is:**
An *example* illustrates how 
a definition applies in practice.
**Purpose:**
To build intuition and show 
that the concept is not empty.
**Example:**
> **Example.** The integers 
((\mathbb{Z}, +)) form a group.

---
### **4. Theorem**

**What it is:**
A *theorem* is a major mathematical 
result—important, general, and usually
central to the chapter.
**Purpose:**
To state a significant truth that will
be proved and later used as a building block.
**Example:**

> **Theorem.** Every finite subgroup of the 
multiplicative group of a field is cyclic.

---
### **5. Proposition**

**What it is:**
A *proposition* is a true mathematical 
statement that is important but not as 
major as a theorem.
**Purpose:**
To state medium-level results that help
build toward bigger ones.
**Example:**
> **Proposition.** Every injective linear 
map between finite-dimensional vector spaces
of equal dimension is surjective.

---
### **6. Lemma**

**What it is:**
A *lemma* is a “helper” result—a smaller
theorem used mainly to prove a larger theorem.
**Purpose:**
To break a difficult proof into understandable chunks.
**Example:**
> **Lemma.** A nonzero polynomial of degree (n) over 
a field has at most (n) roots.
> Used to prove: **Theorem: The fundamental theorem
 of algebra** (among others).

---
### **7. Corollary**

**What it is:**
A *corollary* is a statement that follows
immediately from a theorem with almost
no extra work.
**Purpose:**
To highlight quick consequences of major
results.
**Example:**
> **Corollary.** Every subgroup of a 
cyclic group is cyclic.
> (From the theorem: “Finite subgroups
 of the multiplicative group of a field
 are cyclic.”)

---
### **8. Proof**

**What it is:**
A *proof* is the logical argument demonstrating
that a theorem, lemma, or proposition is true.
**Purpose:**
To justify why a result is valid using previously
established facts.
**Structure:**
Many proofs follow the style:
* Start from assumptions
* Apply known results or definitions
* Argue step by step
* Conclude the statement is true
  Sometimes proofs end with ■ or QED.

---
### **9. Exercise**

**What it is:**
Problems for the reader to solve.
**Purpose:**
To practice the material and 
develop problem-solving skills.
Exercises often range from simple
checks to research-level challenges.

---
### **10. Note / Convention**

**What it is:**
A *note* is extra clarification;
a *convention* is a rule the authors
adopt for simplification.
**Purpose:**
To avoid repeating the same explanations.
**Example:**
> **Convention.** All vector spaces are 
assumed to be over (\mathbb{R}) unless
 stated otherwise.
