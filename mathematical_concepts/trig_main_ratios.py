Trigonometric Functions Beyond Sine and Cosine:

1. Reciprocal Functions
   In addition to 
   sine (sin),
   cosine (cos), 
   and tangent (tan), 
   there are three reciprocal trigonometric functions:

* Cosecant (csc): reciprocal of sine
  csc θ = 1 / sin θ = hypotenuse / opposite
  Use: often appears in problems where
  dividing by sin θ is convenient.

* Secant (sec): reciprocal of cosine
  sec θ = 1 / cos θ = hypotenuse / adjacent
  Use: simplifies expressions where
  dividing by cos θ is needed.

* Cotangent (cot): reciprocal of tangent
  cot θ = 1 / tan θ = adjacent / opposite
  Use: useful in equations involving 
  ratios of sides, especially in 
  calculus and geometry.

2. Purpose of These Functions

* Provide additional tools for 
solving trigonometric equations 
and simplifying expressions.

* Offer alternative ways to write
relationships in right triangles.

* Appear naturally in calculus 
(derivatives, integrals) and 
physics (waves, circuits).

* Allow simpler handling of 
expressions when sine or cosine
are in denominators.

3. Key Relationships and Identities

Reciprocal Relationships:
csc θ = 1 / sin θ
sec θ = 1 / cos θ
cot θ = 1 / tan θ

Pythagorean Identities:
sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1
1 + tan^2 θ = sec^2 θ
1 + cot^2 θ = csc^2 θ

Other Useful Relations:
tan θ = sin θ / cos θ
cot θ = cos θ / sin θ

4. Derivatives 
(Calculus Applications)

d/dx(sin x) = cos x
d/dx(cos x) = -sin x
d/dx(tan x) = sec^2 x
d/dx(cot x) = -csc^2 x
d/dx(sec x) = sec x tan x
d/dx(csc x) = -csc x cot x

* Quick triangle reference:
  sin = opp/hyp, cos = adj/hyp, tan = opp/adj
  csc = hyp/opp, sec = hyp/adj, cot = adj/opp
