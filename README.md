# Personal Learning Notes  

In this repository, I track my reading list and summarize mathematical and software concepts that I review.
This is for my personal learning and reference.

- The notes are organized in the **`mathematical_concepts`** folder.  
- My reading list is maintained in the **`reading_list.md`** file.  

Feel free to explore, but keep in mind that these notes are for my own reference.
